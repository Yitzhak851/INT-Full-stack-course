    <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
    <p>The onload attribute fires when an object has been loaded. <br>
        onload is most often used within the "body" element to execute<br>
        a script once a web page has completely loaded all content (including images,<br>
        script files, CSS files, etc.).<br>
        However, it can be used on other elements as well (see "Supported HTML tags" below).<br>
        The onload attribute can be used to check the visitor's browser type and browser version,<br>
        and load the proper version of the web page based on the information.<br>
        The onload attribute can also be used to deal with cookies (see "More Examples" below)
